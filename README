JavaDrop
--------
This is intended to be a plugin for maven that will be responsible for creating an installable package
for java applications.  There are many solutions out there that take care of this but I never found

Being a maven plugin this has the advantage of integrating more smoothly into the build process. The
primary goal is to be able to keep the settings in the .pom to a mimimum to be able to build something
useful. The hard-work of all the packaging specifics is to be abstracted away inside of this plugin.


Runner Component
----------------
Different software products have different runtime needs. A piece of software might be a linux service.
This software would require a certain set of run scripts. In contrast, another piece of software might
be a stand-alone java application that doesn't require the same service infrastructure but has the need
for some custom run scripts to setup the classpath properly. These runtime needs would be implemented
by a 'runner strategy'.

Packaging Component
-------------------
Different strategies will be available to package the code, source, documentation, etc... up into a
format suitable for the target environment.  One startegy might create a .deb package for debian systems,
for example, while another a .rpm for red hat systems.  This aspect of the plugin is designed to replace
the need for using the maven assembly plugin. 


Runner & Packager interaction
-----------------------------
Packagers can interact with multiple runners.
